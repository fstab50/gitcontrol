## Purpose

Have dozens of local repositories to manage?  If you are like me and your average dev machine has over a 100 git repositories in various states, managing the sprawl can be maddening.

Don't get mad - gitctl

[gitctl](https://github.com/fstab50/gitctl) is a CLI utility for maintaining volumes of git repositories on local machine.
